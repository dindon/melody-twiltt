Twiltt stands for "To Whom I Lend This Thing ?"

TWILTT uses the HTML5's local storage (temp) to persist where is your stuff.

To add a thing you lent to a friend just use the form. Then if you want to edit it, double click on it.

To delete one of the items, you only have to click on the delete button which will appear when your cursor is over the "lend".

Currently under developpement (be kind :p)
